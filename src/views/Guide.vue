            Contracts with arbitration are conventional written contracts coupled with smart contracts that lock the full amount
            of the contract for its entire duration and guarantee that the funds can be unlocked only with mutual agreement of
            both parties, or according to the decision of a mutually agreed arbiter in case a dispute arises.

                (OPTIONAL) You can attest your real name before creating a contract, so it will show up on the contract and your counterparty will see it during contract signing. The same applies to your counterparty.
              </p>
              Real Name attestation can be done via a Real Name Attestation bot found in the Bot Store (the second tab of your chat window). Add this bot and follow its instructions.

              Then, the offerer picks an arbiter from this (or another) ArbStore. You can filter them by their specializations, compare prices for their services, and their recent stats. Copy/paste the address of the chosen arbiter in the field. Discuss the arbiter candidate(s) with the other party to make sure they are OK with your choice.

              Now fill in the contract title and text. Make sure that you mention the names and the roles of both parties in the contract body, like in real-world contracts. The contract text should be written in 3rd person, avoid &laquo;I&raquo; and &laquo;you&raquo; as otherwise the arbiter will have trouble identifying who is who if you have a dispute and the contract lands on the arbiter&rsquo;s desk. The text should be rather long and spell out all the terms and conditions, rights and obligations in your deal with the other party.

              The other party (acceptor) then receives this contract offer via chat, opens and reviews it. They should check the amount of the contract, the currency, the arbiter, and the contract text. If they agree with everything, they accept the contract.

              After the contract is accepted by the acceptor, and the offerer comes online again, their wallet will post a unit into the DAG with the hash of the contract text. The acceptor needs to co-sign this unit, their wallet will prompt them to do so if necessary. This hash signed by both parties serves as a confirmation of their agreement.

                After the &laquo;open dispute&raquo; link was clicked, the arbiter selected in the contract will automatically receive the contract text, briefly review it, and based on the contract&rsquo;s complexity will estimate the cost of their service and ask the plaintiff to pay for it. The payment is processed through the ArbStore this arbiter is enrolled with, so the plaintiff will receive a payment request from the ArbStore in chat. The payment will be held by the ArbStore until the arbiter makes a decision.

              <p>
                After the payment is sent, the arbiter starts resolving the dispute. They will contact both parties through Obyte wallet chat or other means of communication they indicated in the contract, collect evidence from both parties, and make a decision about the party who wins the dispute.

              If the losing party is not satisfied with the arbiter&rsquo;s work, they can appeal the arbiter&rsquo;s decision through contract view. This action will invoke an ArbStore moderator. Although the moderator can&rsquo;t reverse the arbiter decision, they can (partially) compensate the appellant if they find that the arbiter&rsquo;s work was unsatisfactory. The moderator will take a payment for their work and look into the arbiter&rsquo;s decision. They can either agree with the arbiter and close the appeal, or agree with the appellant and pay them a fixed compensation out of the arbiter&rsquo;s deposit with the ArbStore.
