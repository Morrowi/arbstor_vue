            Contracts with arbitration feature of Obyte platform has one major advantage for users: there is a third party arbiter that can resolve any disputes during contract fulfillment. Any user can become an arbiter, making profits by resolving conflicts between users during contract negotiations.
          </div>
          <div class="color-2 mb-4">
            Although being a professional lawyer is best option to become an arbiter, nothing can stop any human from signing up as an arbiter and helping other Obyte users. In the end, its up to users to pick the arbiter they think can fit their needs best, thus having a wide variety of arbiters on ArbStore will only be better, never worse.

                Decide on the fee that the plaintiff will pay for your work. Click the link in chat message from ArbStore (1), it will pre-fill the input field for you in chat with the formatted message containing three fields separated by new lines:
                &mdash; contract_hash
                &mdash; amount
                &mdash; comment
                Now change the amount (2) to the desired value, the asset of the amount is displayed in the message from the ArbStore. On the screenshot the asset is in GB, so the amount will be in GB.
              </p>
              <p>
                Change or leave untouched the comment. It will be visible to plaintiff, so it always good to add some details into it, explaining the amount you asking for or other things in it. At least replace the phrase &laquo;OPTIONAL COMMENT ....&raquo; with some more appropriate text.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leave the contract title there, it will help both you and plaintiff to associate the fee payment request with the contract itself later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Send the message. ArbStore will then ask the plaintiff to pay for your services the exact amount you stated, locking the funds in your deposit. You will be notified when the payment is received.
              </p>
              <p class="pr-100">
                IMPORTANT: You can re-send the same message, changing the amount or the comment, but it will trigger more payment requests to the plaintiff, so use this with caution.
              </p>
              <p class="pr-100">
              Along with the payment request, plaintiff receives your pairing code, so they can chat with you if they have any questions.
